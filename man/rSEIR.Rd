\title{Simulates from a simple stochastic SEIR epidemic model.}
\usage{
rSEIR(
  N0 = 1000,
  I0 = 0,
  S0 = 999,
  R0 = 0,
  E0 = N0 - I0 - S0,
  days = 100,
  pars = c(3, 2, 2, 1, 0.9, 0.3, 0.1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{N0}{An integer. The population size at time 0.}

\item{I0}{An integer. The initial number of infected people.}

\item{S0}{An integer. The initial number of susceptible people.}

\item{R0}{An integer. The initial number of recovered people.}

\item{E0}{An integer. The initial number of exposed people.}

\item{days}{An integer. The number of days for which to simulate.}

\item{pars}{A numeric vector: (a.rate, e.rate, i.rate, r.rate, pE, pSR, pIm).
Description about pars
*\code{a.rate} represents rate of arrival of people into the population.
*\code{e.rate} represents individual being exposed rate at time t is e.rate / Nt.
*\code{i.rate} represents the incubation period is 1/i.rate days.
*\code{r.rate} represents recovery time for each infected individual is 1/ r.rate.
*\code{pE}     represents probability that an arrival is exposed.
*\code{pSR}    represents probability that an exposed individual self-recover and turns susceptible.
*\code{pIm}    represents probability that an infected person is immune after recovery.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with 6 columns.  Row i contains the values of (t, S_t, E_t, I_t, R_t, N_t) at time t.
}
\description{
\code{rSEIR} returns a matrix contains information about time, number of susceptible people, exposed people, infected people,
recover people, total number of people.
